Respected sir,
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Respectfully, I am here to inform you that, I am suffering from fever since last night. 
<br><br>
The doctor had advised me to take 4 days' rest.
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I therefore request you to Grand me 4 days' leave from 09/01/2025 till 12/01/2025
<br><br>
Thank You !
